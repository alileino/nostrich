========
An isometric game engine in C# that was originally made for the course Introduction to game development tools, University of Turku.
This version has no actual game content at the moment, only the bare engine. Hopefully in the coming weeks that will change and some
placeholder content will be added.

Libraries:
  - OpenTK: Graphics
  - IronPython: Scripting
